# Scribble-Doctor
## Speech Enabled Medical Prescriptor using Google Web Speech API and SpeechRecognition.
### Introduction
In general scenarios doctors prescribe medications to a patient using medical prescription slips. Keeping in mind the long queue of patients expecting to be treated/examined early, the major disadvantage of using prescription slips is wastage of paper, energy and time. And of course, the horrible handwriting of doctors!! <br/> <br/> Therefore, I have used the speech to text conversion algorithm to automate the process with SpeechRecognition using Google Web Speech API to help the physicians quickly deal with the patient's medication by simply speaking out the required drug names and usage details. This way the entire process will became smooth, faster and transparent as the patient & pharmacists also get to understand what medications the patient has been assigned with.

### Installations
Install the following modules:
- ```pip install SpeechRecognition```
- ```pip install pipwin```
