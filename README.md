## AI Enabled Medical Prescription Generator using [Google Web Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text).
### OBJECTIVE: To develop an AI enabled medical PDF prescription generator using Automatic Speech Recognition to speed up the medication process.

### Introduction
In general scenarios, doctors prescribe medications to a patient using medical prescription slips. Keeping in mind the long queue of patients expecting to be treated/examined early, the major disadvantage of using prescription slips is wastage of paper, energy and time. And of course, with due respect, the horrible handwriting of doctors!!
<br/> <br/>
Therefore, I've used the speech-to-text conversion algorithm to automate the process with [**SpeechRecognition**](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) using [**Google Web Speech API**](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) to help the physicians quickly deal with the patient's medication by simply speaking out the required drug names and usage details. This way the entire process will become smooth, faster and transparent as the patient & pharmacists also get to understand what medications the patient has been assigned.
